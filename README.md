# Smart Gesture Glove  

## 📌 Overview  
A low-cost **gesture recognition glove** using copper plates instead of flex sensors.  
When plates touch, signals are sent to **Arduino Uno + ESP32**, triggering **audio (buzzer/speaker)** and **visual (LCD)** feedback.  

## ⚙️ Components  
- Wool glove + copper plates  
- Arduino Uno + ESP32  
- LCD display, buzzer, speaker, WiFi module  
- Small housing box + wires  

## 🎯 Why This Design?  
- Wool → flexible, cheap, comfortable  
- Copper plates → budget-friendly, no movement restriction (unike flex sensors)  
- Avoided leather + flex sensors (expensive, less mobility)  

## 🚀 Features  
- Audio + visual outputs  
- Low-cost and user-friendly  
- Scalable for assistive and wearable tech
