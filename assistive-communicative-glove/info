Problem Statement:
Individuals with speech or hearing impairments struggle to communicate with those unfamiliar with sign language. This communication gap leads to reduced independence, social interaction and mental health issues.

Primary Objectives and Relevance:
Design and develop a glove that detects hand gestures using sensors.
Convert recognized gestures into audio or textual output in real time.
Make it into communication + Health assessment tool

Model Description:
Glove connected to a small box housing ESP32, Arduino Uno, and circuit connections.
On the glove, male and female copper plates detect contact and send signals to the microcontroller. Plates replace flex sensors which avoids movement restrictions.
Small box includes- ESP32, LCD display, WiFi module, speaker, buzzer, and connecting wires.
When plates touch, signal triggers audio + visual output.

Tools & Techniques Used:
Glove made from regular wool (flexible, cost-effective).
Wool chosen instead of leather â†’ lower cost + better mobility (leather = thicker, more expensive).
Budget-friendly copper plates used for sensing.
Arduino Uno + ESP32 for control and connectivity.
Components selected to balance user comfort and hand mobility.

outcomes:
Functional prototype glove that assists users with speech disabilities using hand gestures.
Clear audio and screen-based message output foraccessibility.
Wireless medical data logging, useful for hospitals or care centers (healthwave+).
Foundation for expanding into broader health monitoring for patients with limited mobility.
